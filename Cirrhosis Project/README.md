## **Overview** 
In this kaggle project, the challenge was to make a multi-class approach to predict the the outcomes of patients with cirrhosis. Approaches utilized for the challenge includes Random Forest and XGBoost. 

## **Summary of Work Done** 
### Data
  - Tabular
  - Came with a train.csv and a test.csv
  - Evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss, where each ID in the test set is assigned a single true class label named "Status."
  - The submission containing predicted probabilities for 3 potential outcomes: Status_C, Status_CL, and Status_D for each ID.
  - 
#### First looking at the Training set
- Size : (7905, 20)
- Columns are numerical and categorical
  - Drug column had sepcified names
  - Sex column categorized as M/F
  - Columns like Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, & Edema arr also categorized into N/Y
  
- No missing values
- No duplicate rows

- Target column (Status) is encoded
  - C = alive at N_Days
  - D = deceased after N_Days
  - CL = alive at N_Days due to liver a transplant

- Outliers
  - Implemented IQR to find outliers of the numerical columns
  - Also added a lower and upper bounds
  - Over half of the numerical columns had outliers


For example: Alk_Phos had the most outliers (792)

 #### Quick look at the Test Set
 - Size : (7905, 19)
   - The target column ('Status') is dropped
    
- Had similar results to the training set looking into the test csv

### Data Visualization 
- Looked at distributions of numerical columns
  - Over half of the numerical columns had a right skew

- Created KDE histograms for every feature between the target classes (D/C/CL)
  - Noticed that Age was in days and not in years

### Preprocessing / Clean Up
- Since Age was set in days I converted it to years
  
- To handle the numerical columns having the right skew
  - I did log transformation to have a better scale since this technique compress the range of data.

Distributions after cleaning & transformation

### Problem Formulation / Machine Learning 
- Training :
  - I dropped the 'id' column
  - Split the training set using train_test_split
  - Used LabelEncoder to encode the categorical columns
  - Also used LabelEncoder to encode target column ('Status') 

- Algorithms chosen :
  - Random Forest : The outcome & time is considered until a status is met.
  - XG Boost : Can perform classification and regression tasks.
    - Since the "Status" is categorical in can also take into factor the amount of time ('N_Days') for predictions.

### **Perfromance/Model Evaluations :** 
  - Metrics included 
    - Logarithmic Loss 
    - Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1)

## **Conclusion:**
  - XGBoost appears to be the better model overall in metric comparison
  - Has a lower log loss, implies more confidence and accuracy in probability predictions
  - Recall and macro average F1-score, XGBoost performs slightly better

## **Future Work**
- Apply hyper parameter tuning to improve model accuracy
  - Considerg Bayesian optimization as it finds the point that achieves the maximal result.
  - Makes predictions on validation data & calculating validation metrics
  - Faster than GridSreach
- Create more visuals for better analysis
  - Since I focused more on numerical columns, in the future it would be useful to also look into the categorical columns
